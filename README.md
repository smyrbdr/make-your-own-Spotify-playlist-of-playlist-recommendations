# make-your-own-Spotify-playlist-of-playlist-recommendations

This code snippet helps you create your own Spotify public playlist containing recommended tracks for each track in a source public playlist using Spotipy library.

Here is the original library;

[Spotipy Documentation](http://spotipy.readthedocs.org/)

[Spotipy GitHub repo](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy)

You should first create a Spotify web API via [Spotify for Developers](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/)

Get your APP credentials to provide into the code.

You should get and set the following information first;

```python
cid =' ' # Client ID; copy this from your app
secret = ' ' # Client Secret; copy this from your app
username = ' ' # Your Spotify username

#for available scopes see https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/using-scopes/
scope = 'user-library-read playlist-modify-public playlist-read-private'

redirect_uri=' ' # Your app URL
```
